# Express Delivery
This project shows how to add a new feature allowing the creation of new presets that can be attached to an order. Presets are time limits on how fast an order needs to be processed. Preset information is shown in the Order Overview when a preset is attached to the order.

# Concepts shown
To implement the feature, the following extensibility points are used
- Creating new list, edit and prompt screens with models, queries and commands
- Injecting new UI onto existing screens
- Adding nodes to existing trees
- Creating custom UI components with client-side logic
- Update providers for manipulating the database

The project also shows how to use these different concepts together. For example how to use existing screen information and prompt the user for more information and use it to create new relations.
